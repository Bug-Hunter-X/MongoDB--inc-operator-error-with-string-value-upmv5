# MongoDB $inc operator error with string value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB to increment a field's value. The error arises from attempting to increment a field that contains a string value instead of a number.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator.  The code attempts to increment the `count` field, but `count` is a string, leading to an unexpected outcome.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the `count` field is of numeric type before using the `$inc` operator.  If the field is initially a string, it needs to be converted to a number first, possibly via an update query.

## How to reproduce
1.  Set up a MongoDB instance.
2.  Create a collection.
3.  Insert a document with a string field (e.g., `count: '1'`).
4.  Run the buggy code to attempt to increment the string field.
5.  Observe the unexpected behavior.

## How to fix
1.  Correctly type the field as a number in your initial document insert.
2.  If the field already exists as a string, convert it to a number before using `$inc`.   This could involve using `$toInt` within the update query.
